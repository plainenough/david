class DavidServer(object):
    """
    Represents a simplified service model named DavidServer, primarily designed
     for demonstrating basic file handling and conditional logic in Python. 

    Attributes:
        authority (str): A string representing the current authority, 
        +defaulting to an environmental variable 'GOD' or 'DJ' if the 
        environment variable is not set.
        prime_directive (str): The primary instruction or purpose of this 
        server instance, determined by reading from 'instructions.txt' file 
        at initialization.

    Methods:
        __init__(self): Initializes a new instance of DavidServer, setting up 
        the authority and discovering the prime directive by reading from 
        'instructions.txt'.
        __str__(self): Provides a string representation of the DavidServer 
        instance, requesting not to delve too deeply into its internals.
        discover_purpose(self): Attempts to read the prime directive from 
        'instructions.txt'. If the file is not found, defaults to a 
        predetermined purpose.
        get_toast(self): Determines the output based on the prime directive. 
        If the directive is 'Pass the butter', returns 'buttered toast'; 
        otherwise, claims 'Toast is a lie'.

    Usage:
        server = DavidServer()
        print(server.get_toast())  # Output depends on the contents of 
        'instructions.txt'
        print(server.prime_directive)  # Shows the prime directive of the 
        server

    Note:
        The class includes a whimsical approach to naming and purpose 
        description, reflecting a non-standard use case.
