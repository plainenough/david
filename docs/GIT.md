# Enhanced Git Commit Standards and Best Practices

Incorporating prefixes in commit messages and using lowercase enhances clarity and project management. Follow these guidelines for effective Git commits:

## Commit Messages

### 1. Prefix and Lowercase Commit Messages

- **Prefixes**:
  - `fix:` for commits that correct a bug in the code.
  - `feat:` for commits that introduce new features.
  - `chore:` for maintenance tasks that don't modify the application code or test files.
- **Lowercase**: Start all commit messages with a lowercase letter.
- **Format**: `[prefix]: [short, descriptive message]`. For example, `feat: add user login endpoint`.

### 2. Clear and Concise Commit Messages

- **Title**: Keep the title short (50 characters or less). The prefix and concise description should summarize the changes effectively.


### 3. Use the Imperative Mood

- Frame your commit message as if giving an order or instruction, e.g., `fix: correct typo in endpoint`.

### 4. No Period at the End of the Title

- Commit titles should be brief and to the point, without a period at the end.

### 5. Reference Issues or Tickets

- Include related issue numbers at the end of the commit message, e.g., `feat: implement user authentication (closes #45)`.

## Commit Content

### 6. Atomic Commits

- Make atomic commits that encapsulate a single logical change. This granularity aids in code review and potential rollback scenarios.

### 7. Incremental Changes

- Use `git add -p` for partial commits to break down your work into smaller, manageable chunks.

## Branching and Merging

### 8. Descriptive Branch Names

- Use clear, descriptive names for branches that reflect the commitsâ€™ intent, like `feature/user-authentication`, `bugfix/login-error`, or `chore/update-dependencies`.

### 9. Regular Updates

- Frequently rebase feature branches onto the main branch to reduce merge conflicts and ensure alignment with the base branch.

## Pull Requests and Code Review

### 10. Detailed Pull Request Descriptions

- Clearly describe what the pull request changes, why those changes were made, and any other relevant context. Use lowercase for consistency.

### 11. Mandatory Code Reviews

- All changes should be reviewed by at least one peer before merging to maintain code quality and foster knowledge sharing among team members.

## Additional Guidelines

- **Amending Commits**: Use `git commit --amend` carefully, mainly to correct recent commit messages before pushing to a shared repository.
- **Tagging Releases**: Employ Git tags for release points, such as `v1.0.0`, ensuring the use of semantic versioning.

By following these refined Git commit standards and practices, teams can enjoy a streamlined, transparent, and efficient development process.
